          Searching specifically for the solution to your problem can very often yield some great painting tutorials, and forums can be useful in this regard. With forums you have the advantage of being able to ask your specific question and very often people will come back with (a variety of) answers.</p>
<p>
Fundamentally, as painters who work with realism as a base, there are two major skill sets: 
</p><p>
Firstly, your physical skills, including:
</p><p>
          <ul>
            <li> √ Mixing colour              </li>
            <li> √ Dexterity with a brush     </li>
            <li> √ Range of brush applications</li>
            <li> √ Understanding colour theory</li>
            <li> √ Understanding perspective  </li>
            <li> √ Understanding composition  </li>
          </ul>
and so many more…..
</p><p>
The second most important thing is your perception or observation skills. This involves discovering all of the information that you need to create a convincing piece of artwork, for example:
</p><p>
          <ul>
<li> √ How does the light hit a tree? </li>           
<li> √ What gives that cloud depth in the sky?</li>
<li> √ What makes water look like water?</li>
<li> √ How are things affected by light?</li>
<li> √ What is the negative space doing?</li>
</ul>
  and so much more…..
</p><p>
When one of these areas is out of balance, our paintings don't work. If, for example, you can see the information you need, but you can't get your brush to do what you need it to - this is the area where you need some help mastering the skills. Drag out a blank canvas, and train your brush. Practise makes perfect.

If, you feel comfortable with your brushwork, but don't seem to be able to make the work convincing; there is probably some information missing. You need to learn to look more closely at your subject, to discover the subtlety & nuances that make or breaks it.
</p><p>
Go into the world and look around. Dissect it. Layer, upon layer. Make notes and observe.  Discover your own painting tutorials.
</p><p>
Good painting tutorials will address both of those areas.
</p><p>
It's important to note that you are not on your own. Someone out there somewhere has struggled with the same thing you are struggling with, and been victorious!

              Water is one of the most compelling subjects to paint, and yet it can all end so badly. The problem often is where to start?<br></br>
I wrestled with creating the illusion of fluidity, clarity and some semblance of realism for a long time.
Eventually I discovered a way of looking at water that allows us to recreate it in almost any circumstance. <br></br> The trick is to break it down into manageable pieces, rather than try and paint it in its entirety.  When you understand how these pieces affect each other, learning how to paint water becomes much easier.   You will find that you may look at water in an entirely different way.


</p>
            <img src="https://www.explore-acrylic-painting.com/images/250xNxhow-to-paint-water-shallow-substrate.jpg.pagespeed.ic.l0O8SFYjHt.jpg">
          </div>
            
  <p>
Before we start, however, there are a couple of things I need to say. When painting something realistically there are two overriding skills needed, and particularly when learning to paint water:
</p><p>
Firstly, your technical ability, or your ability to use a brush, mix colour etc. 
Secondly, your ability to observe, and find the detail necessary to create something that is convincing.
This tutorial is primarily about the "details" I use when painting water. 
</p><p>
The next point is that this strategy is not the only way, nor possibly the best way. But it works brilliantly for me, and hopefully will for you, as you learn how to represent water in your paintings.
</p><p>
Now that's out of the way, let's get into it!
</p><p>
When learning to paint water realistically, it is important to consider that the appearance of water is made up of four elements:
</p><p>
The substrate (or bottom. No, not bottoms. This is how to paint water - not how to paint figures).
The colour of the water (determined by what is suspended in it)
The surface of the water
The light</p>

        <article>
          <p>
          Early in art history, there was a fascination for painting landscapes. I think this is because of our fundamental connection with the environment. It's part of who we are.
</p>          <p>
It is even more important these days, when we are being pulled away from just "being" with nature. Time and responsibilities get in the way. Investigating the world to find a landscape to paint is not only fun, but also good for your soul.
</p>          <p>

Disclaimer: you will probably live longer - not my fault.  Be warned.
</p>          <p>

When doing a landscape painting, the process I use is as follows: I should say this is my way, it's possibly not the "right" way, whatever that is.
</p>          <p>

Choosing Your Image
I spend hours looking at the world, taking photos and making sketches. Choosing an image to paint is half the fun!
</p>          <p>

Get out there in the world and take some notes about what lights you up.
        </p>  <p>

What lights you up is what you should paint.
    </p>      <p>

The only advice I offer is that in the early stages, you should try to choose images that are reasonably simple. A complicated image will crush your will to live. (Or at the very least have you chucking a tanty. Um….hang on, maybe that's just me).
</p>          <p>

Roughing In
In this case, we have used Napthol Red Light as a ground. Start by blocking in darks. You may wish to consider blocking in your darks with an unexpected colour such as Dioxazine Purple.
</p>          <p>

If you're not comfortable with going straight to paint, you can mark your painting out in chalk first.
</p>          <p>

landscape painting - roughing in
You can "warm up" or "cool down" a painting with the colours you use in your underpainting. Flashes of that colour will appear, making your landscape painting more lively and interesting.
</p>          <p>

The important thing though, is that you lay out your structure. Horizon here, trees there, hill over there, creepy toothless farmer behind shrubbery, etc.
</p>          <p>

This is a great way of "balancing" all of the elements at a very early stage, so changes can be made if necessary.
</p>          <p>

landscape painting - positioning the elements
This leads us to composition. There are lots and lots of rules regarding composition. When you find out what they are, please let me know!
</p>          <p>

Seriously now, essentially they are using the elements so that there are no "empty" spots in the painting.
        </p>  <p>

You can "balance" a painting by adding forms (structure) or movement (direction of objects for example).
    </p>      <p>

As an example, a person looking towards the centre of the painting can lead your eye in that direction.
</p>          <p>

landscape painting - composition
You can also use tone to balance a painting. I recently painted a large headland in a panoramic format. This large block of tone sat fairly heavily on the right hand side. I needed an element to counterbalance that. Rather than using darkness, I used a very bright sunrise to create interest and attention on the far left. Voila. Sorted.
    </p>      <p>

Think a bit creatively about solving compositional problems. A very basic format for a balanced composition is this example of the "square rule", which involves placing your prominent or significant compositional object along a line that roughly breaks your painting into a square and a rectangle:
</p>          <p>

landscape painting - square rule
Ultimately though, rules are made to be broken. And breaking the rules can sometimes help you say what you want to say with more power.
    </p>      <p>

Creating an "unbalanced" composition can make viewing a painting slightly uncomfortable. Handy, if that's your goal.
</p>          <p>

Once you've blocked in darks, it's often handy to work out your lights. In other words, find a large area of the palest colour, and block that in (for example the sky). This will give you your two tonal extremes.
        </p>  <p>

landscape painting - block in your darks and lights
After this point I block in all the "intermediate" colours such as highlights on trees, large grassy areas, blocking in rocks and working from dark to light.
    </p>      <p>

There are several reasons for approaching your landscape painting in this way:
</p>          <p>

It is a great opportunity to check the composition, and see if all of the structure, and the tones within the piece are balanced. It's not too late to move things around.
</p>          <p>

Imagine you're firing a rifle. The first shot misses. But it's close - so you adjust your sights. Think of your landscape painting in the same way. The roughing in process is your first shot.
</p>          <p>

Every layer after this is adjusting. Acrylics on white canvas can often be quite transparent. A second coat is a good idea for building "strength" in your darks.
</p>          <p>

Never be afraid to build layers on top of one another. It will all add to the interest.
    </p>      <p>

PS. Every time you paint, you improve your brush skills!
</p>          <p>

Intermediate Stage
At this point I re-establish the sky. Often the sky is a large area requiring some subtle shifts in hue and tone. For me, I want to focus purely on that and not worry about overpainting something. I get the sky as close to finished as possible, knowing that I'll probably have to touch up some parts later. Now we move on.
        </p>  <p>

Because your darks are now quite solid, you have something to build on. Start looking at the "intermediate" colours and tones in relation to the darks. See if you can isolate the next dark colour (slightly lighter than the darkest dark).
    </p>      <p>

As examples, look at the trees and see if you can find the next "lightest" colour. And paint it!
</p>          <p>



landscape painting - adding intermediate colours
Apply the same principle to everything else within that "dark" tonal range, for example, grass, rocks, cows, creepy dudes, etc.
        </p>  <p>

At this point you can still apply highlights. BUT. The approach is "tighter" than the roughing in process. In other words, you are putting gradually more detail into your landscape painting, allowing it to evolve in layers.
    </p>      <p>

This will eventually give your painting much more life and dimension.
</p>          <p>

Now is the time to start really using the nuances of your paintbrush. The amount of pressure you apply, the amount of pigment you apply, and how deftly you use your brush - all of these things are becoming much more important.
</p>          <p>

Time to understand your paintbrushes people! The better you understand your paintbrush, the happier you will be with this stage of your landscape painting.
</p>          <p>

Final Stage
Now it's time to tidy up. This is where we apply the final subtle highlights to the edges of the trees, or possibly even add daubs of the sky colour (daubs: such a good word) into the trees to create the impression of gaps in the foliage.
</p>          <p>

This is where we tidy up any places that overlap. Trees over sky, tree trunks over grass, and finer leaves and branches in foliage.
</p>          <p>

This is also a great place to add flashes of colour by suggesting wildflowers, or even just spots of colour 'cause you can. Often, those little flashes are the thing that makes the landscape painting "pop". It would be very boring without them.

I like to coat my paintings with a coat of protective clear (I use Atelier Gloss Medium & Varnish - think they are changing the name to just Gloss Varnish ). 
        </p>  <p>

Some of you may prefer a matt look. That's also possible, and there are lots of products on the market. Whatever you use, just remember to use something. This will protect your wonderful landscape painting for generations to come. (Serves those grandchildren right!).
    </p>      <p>

You'll develop your own process for creating your own great landscape painting. But two things are very important.
</p>          <p>

Develop your powers of observation:
         </p> <p>

Being able to find vital pieces of information will make finding good subjects much more fun. It will also make painting them more fun and much more satisfying.
         </p> <p>

Develop your brush skills:
        </p>  <p>

All over this site there are lots of little tips and techniques that will help you do that. Or for our DVD tutorials click here! 
    </p>      <p>

Have fun exploring!
</p>          <p>

Ultimately, the more skills you have, the more freedom you have to chuck paint around, especially with landscape painting.          </p>

<p>          Shadow painting doesn’t mean dancing around with a paintbrush in front of a light. (Although, whatever tickles your fancy......please, no photos.....).
</p><p>
how to paint shadows tutorial with Mark Waller
It’s easy to think of shadows just as shadows. Shadow painting can be a wonderful way of introducing more life, depth, dimension and colour to your work.             
 </p><p>
The way you paint your shadows can make or break your paintings.
 </p><p>
For the purposes of this tutorial, we’ll break our shadow painting into two groups:
 </p><p>
          
Shadows ON something - so in other words, a shadow being cast onto a tree trunk, or grass or a wall, for example.
 </p><p>
Shadows IN something - the darks amongst the foliage of a tree, for example.
 </p><p>
The shadows IN something can give volume, depth and dimension to the object being painted. The shadows ON something create planes within your picture (horizontal and vertical planes).
    </p>
          <br> </br>
          <img src="https://www.explore-acrylic-painting.com/images/xShadow-In-1.jpg.pagespeed.ic.oJ3NxtwEvC.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right: 20px;"/>
 <p>       We’ve all seen the row of fence posts/telegraph poles receding into the distance with the shadows being cast onto the ground.
</p><p>
It’s important how you approach this example of shadow painting.
</p><p>
The way you paint the shadows on the ground adds to the illusion of a roughly horizontal plane receding.
</p><p>
Shadows ON Something - I love painting shadows on stuff. Not only can you get a sense of the plane that the shadow falls on, but it also gives you information about the object that is casting the shadow.
</p><p>
I mentioned trees before - what a wonderful thing it is to paint the dappled light that finds its way through the leaves of a tree. Think of the impressionists.

          Sunset painting and painting at sunset!  The time you have to document colours at sunset is limited.  You have to get throw some colour down fast - so that you have a basic record of the colours, paying particular note of the important ones.  
</p><p>
Digital photography now makes the process of saving information a lot easier, so as well as your rough colour record, take some photographs and go back to the studio, away from the mozzies. (And close to the bar fridge!)
</p><p>
Ahhhh....Time to paint.
</p><p>
The approach for me is as usual....get colour down fast.  This will give you something to start with.  Having said that, it doesn’t mean that you just hurl any colour down anywhere.  Have an educated first attempt.  With pretty much any sunset or sunset painting that I can think of, follow a simple rule:
